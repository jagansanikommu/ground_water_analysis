# ground_water_analysis

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis on groundwater data for different states in India. The analysis provides insights into groundwater extraction, availability, allocation, and distribution at both the state and district levels.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following information:

- State-wise groundwater extraction
- Annual groundwater availability
- Groundwater allocation to districts

The dataset is available in the file `groundwater_data.csv`. It is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that can be easily imported and analyzed using various data analysis libraries.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data`: This folder contains the dataset file `Data.csv`.
- `notebooks`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
- `plots`: This folder stores the generated plots and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and its components.

## Requirements
